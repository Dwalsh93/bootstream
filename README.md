In this project the goal was to modify existing code for Horiseons website for accessibility purposes. 
 
Repetitive CSS was consolidated, classes with identical properties were renamed in HTML to make appropriate changes on the CSS page. 

On the HTML document, alt tags were added to images for accessibility readers and id's were added to main content sections so that the links in the header work properly.
